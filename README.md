XenonHD Backup Tool: Privacy policy

As an Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I am against the applications that collect your data without your knowledge.

I have designed this app to not collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and backup data) created by you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
